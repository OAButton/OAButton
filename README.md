## Open Access Button Prototype

A prototype version of the Open Access Button idea explained in [this blog](http://oabutton.wordpress.com/2013/07/06/our-project-short-version/).

#### Demo

[Have a look at the demo](http://oabutton.herokuapp.com/) - however **please do not share too widely as we're pre-launch!**

#### Contributing

If you want to contribute, we have some [instructions for setting up your local dev environment](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/blob/develop/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Our code is completely open source and we invite/need developers to get involved in this amazing project. Currently we're trying to focus on attaining [our minimum viable product](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5NV6PoUPiB8GmxRvIO0onDnv8bV69BeDGDco9uHxik/edit) before moving into our testing phase, provisionally on 1 October 2013. That should allow us to launch on 18 November 2013, in time for the [Berlin 11 Student & Early Stage Researcher Satellite Conference](http://berlin2013.sched.org/) on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the [Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities](http://openaccess.mpg.de/286432/Berlin-Declaration)! If you have suggestions, we are more than open to them, however, and post this date, we can think about broader development.

As mentioned, we're working to a tight deadline and many people are counting on this tool launching in time, so please try to work on [high priority issues](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/issues). Also, we discuss the projects development more broadly on our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/open-access-button). Where possible open ended questions should be made here, rather than in issues.
