## Open Access Button

The Open Access Button idea is explained in [this blog post](http://blog.openaccessbutton.org/2013/07/06/our-project-short-version/).

The button is live! Check out http://www.openaccessbutton.org

#### Contributing

If you want to contribute, we have some [instructions for setting up your local dev environment](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/blob/develop/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

Our code is completely open source and we invite/need developers to get involved in this amazing project. Currently we're trying to focus on converting the current bookmarklet to a fully fledged browser plugin, and attempting to automate use as far as possible.
The goal is for a major launch of Button 2.0 during [Open Access Week](http://openaccessweek.org) which runs from 20 -- 26 October 2014.

If you have any suggestions or feature requests, please feel free to get in touch, and we will see what we can do.

As mentioned, we're working to a tight deadline and many people are counting on this tool launching in time, so please try to work on [high priority issues](https://github.com/OAButton/OAButton/issues). We discuss the projects development more broadly on our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/openaccessbuttondevelopers). Where possible, open ended questions should be made there, rather than as github issues.
